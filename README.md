# team6project
CSC 131 project

Proposed Project Description:
Our goal for this project is to design a web software application that will allow student users to sign into a roster within a specified location range and timeframe. This is made with the intention of preventing students who are not within the vicinity of the classroom to sign in.

Project Goals:
We are building our project with the following tasks (aka Functional Requirements), which will eventually have additional subtasks that will go into further detail as we progress through the project. Ownership of each task/subtask will be rotated and switched off each Sprint. Each Sprint will be 7 days. This is a team collaboration effort to get each Sprint done before the finalization and end product of a prototype.
